  <h1 style="color:#4485b8; font-size:150%; font-weight:normal;">Set Data Source</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%; font-weight:normal;">Select File Geodatabase</h2>
  <p>Click on the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Browse</span> button to open the directory dialogue.
    Navigate to the File Geodatabase that contains your receptor points. <strong>This must be a folder with a '.gdb' extension.</strong> Click
    the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Select Folder</span> button.
      The file path to the File Geodatabase and a green tick mark will appear. The dropdown menu below will be populated with the names of all point feature classes in this
      File Geodatabase. Depending on the size of the File Geodatabase this may take a while.</p>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%; font-weight:normal;">Receptor Points</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu, select the feature class that contains the receptor points. It is recommended to use a feature class that does not contain spatial duplicates, as the presence of spatial
    duplicates will slow down the performance of the tool.</p>
    <p> A green tick mark will appear and
    the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Next ></span>
  button will be activated. This completes the Receptors from Feature Class step.</p>
  <p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000;background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px">If the LUR models contain predictors that are derived from
    the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value * Inverse Distance, or Value * Inverse distance squared to the nearest feature, then any receptor points
    located on top of the nearest feature will result in a division by zero error, because the distance is zero. To prevent this, the wizard will check if
    the LUR model contains an Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value * Inverse Distance, or Value * Inverse distance squared predictor. If this is the case, the wizard will
    remove any receptor points located on top of the relevant features. The warning message <em>"Invalid receptor points. See log for details."</em> will appear and the Apply_LOG will record
    which predictor variable resulted in the removal of receptor points. The Apply_LOG will also record the initial and final number of receptor points used.</p>
