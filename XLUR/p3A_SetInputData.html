  <h1 style="color:#4485b8; font-size:150%;font-weight:normal;">Set Input Data</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Polygon Feature Class</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the polygon feature class from which you would like to extract data. The polygon feature class should have a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The polygon
    feature class should not contain spatial duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Check Geometry or Repair Geometry tool prior to running the wizard).
    The polygon feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each polygon. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should
    be created with all rows set to the same text string. If the Area weighted value or Area * Value aggregation method will be used, the polygon feature class must also contain a numeric field.</p>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Category Field</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the text field, which identifies the category of each polygon. If the feature class contains only one category, select a dummy text field in which
  all rows are set to the same text string. </p>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Aggregation Method</h2>
  <p>Select the aggregation method to be used for this predictor variable.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Total area</em> - This will calculate the sum of all polygon areas within each buffer and category. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pA" target="_blank">Click here</a>
      for further details. </li>
    <li><em>Area weighted value</em> - This will calculate an area weighted value within each buffer and category. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pA" target="blank">Click here</a>
        for further details.
    <li><em>Area * Value</em> - This will multiply the area of each polygon with a user selected value field. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pA" target="blank">Click here</a>
          for further details.
  </ul>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Value Field</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the numeric field to be used in the Area weighted value or Area * Value aggregation method. If this field contains missing data, then polygons with missing values may be extracted in the
    intersect analysis. Please be aware that the Area weighted value and Area * Value aggregation methods will ignore rows with missing data and the calculated value will be based on the non-missing data only.
    After a field has been selected a green tick mark will appear.</p>
