  <p>Select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable: a positive
    direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is
    expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a sink of the dependent
    variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user
    must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong></p>
    <p>Click the
    <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Done</span> button. A green tick mark will appear and the
    <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Next ></span> button will be activated. This completes the Value of Raster cell step.
    The newly created predictor variables will be listed in the Predictors Added box on the next page.</p>
